1. This movement is performed on a declined bench. Bring the weights up to your knees first then lie down with them or get someone to pass the weights to you once you are in position.
2. Grasp the dumbbells with overhand grips. Begin with the dumbbells together pressed up directly above your chest. Your elbows should be slightly bent, and your palms facing each other.
3. Carefully - simultaneously, lower the weights down to either sides of your body. You will feel a stretch in the outer pectorals. Keep your palms facing inward and maintain a slight bend in the elbows. Once the dumbbells are parallel with the bench, pause.
4. Hold for 1 second, then press back up in the same arch and contract you pectorals.
