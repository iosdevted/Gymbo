1. This exercise is done in a seated position on a calf machine similar to the one shown in the pictures. Adjust the pad so that your shins are straight up and the pad is just behind the knees.
2. Lift the weight by pushing your heels up with the balls of your feet.
3. Slowly lower the heels until you feel a stretch in the calf muscle.
4. To target inner and outer calves, point your toes inwards and outwards respectively.
