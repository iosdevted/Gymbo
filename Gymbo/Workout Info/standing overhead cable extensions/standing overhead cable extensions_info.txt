1. Stand with your back facing a cable machine. The triceps bar should be attached to the upper pulley.
2. Grab the triceps bar. Keep one foot forward and one behind for support, then lean forward.
3. The starting position has your elbows bent at 90 degrees, pointing straight forward, with the bar above your head.
4. Slowly extend your elbows until your arms are straight. Try not to move your upper arms, just extend the elbows.
5. Hold for 2 seconds, contracting triceps muscles, then slowly return to starting position.
