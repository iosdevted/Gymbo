1. This exercise can be done in the sissy squat machine as shown in the pictures above, or without machines by holding a vertical bar with one arm for support.
2. Stand in the machine with your legs completely against the pads, your arms across your chest and your body over your ankles.
3. Slowly lower your body into a sitting position.
4. Using the heels of your feet, push your body back up to the starting position and contract your thighs.
