2. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and slightly bent to relieve stress from your lower back. Place one hand on your hip for balance and stability. Grasp the handle with an underhand grip.
3. Keep your arm close to your side, but do allow your elbow to raise slightly. Don't lean forward, keep straight posture. Press the weight down until your arm is fully extended. Contract your triceps.
