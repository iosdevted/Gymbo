1. Position yourself in a leg press machine that is either flat or inclined to the ground. Your feet should be shoulder width apart with your head and back resting comfortably on the machine.
2. Unlock the weight and slowly lower the weight, bending the knees and hips until you reach 90 degrees.
3. Push the platform up using the heels of your feet until your knees are almost fully extended, returning to the starting position.
