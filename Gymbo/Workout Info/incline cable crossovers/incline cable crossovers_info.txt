1. This movement is performed on a slightly inclined bench, roughly 30 degrees. Locate the bench between to ground level cables. Lay down on the bench, placing your feet flat on the ground.
2. Be sure to keep your back flat against the bench. Grasp a cable handle in each hand. Lay flat with your arms extended out to each side.
3. Simultaneously, bring each cable directly above your chest, in an arced path. Be sure to keep your elbows slightly bent. Contract your upper and inner chest muscles.
4. Hold for 1-2 seconds, then lower back down to the starting position.
