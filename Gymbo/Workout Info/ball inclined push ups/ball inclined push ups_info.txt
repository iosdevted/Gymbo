1. Begin with your body in a straight, prone position. Feet on the ground and hands on the ball holding yourself up with arms extended.
2. Lower yourself down bending at the elbows until your chest barely touches the ball. Pause, then slowly extend your arms to the starting position.
3. Be sure to breath in as you lower yourself down and breath out as you push up off the ball.
