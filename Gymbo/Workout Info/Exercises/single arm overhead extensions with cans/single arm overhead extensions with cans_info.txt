1. This movement is performed in a seated or standing position.
2. If standing, stand with feet shoulder width apart and knees slightly bent to relieve stress from lower back. If sitting, keep your back straight and don't hunch over. Place one hand on your waist for balance and grab a can with your other hand.
3. Begin with your elbow pointing straight up and bent at a 90 degree angle. Raise the can straight up, keeping your elbow stationary. Pause and contract your triceps.
4. Slowly lower the can back to the starting position or until you feel a slight stretch. Pause and repeat the movement.
5. Repeat for both arms.
