1. Sit on the ball. Keep your back straight and both feet out in front, flat on the ground.
2. Slowly roll forwards, contracting your hamstring muscles.
3. Slowly roll back to the starting position.
4. To make it more difficult, hold legs farther out, but be careful not to go too far or you will roll right off the ball.
