1. Sit in the machine. Adjust the back rest such that when your back is flat against the back rest, your knees are lined up with the pivot point of the machine. The lower pad should be just above your heels.
2. Bend your knees slowly, contracting the hamstring muscles. Stop when you cannot go any farther.
3. Slowly bring your heels back to the starting position.
