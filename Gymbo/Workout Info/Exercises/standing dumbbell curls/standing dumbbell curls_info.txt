1. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and slightly bent to relieve stress from your lower back.
2. Grasp each dumbbell with an underhand grip. Begin with the dumbbells hanging straight down at your sides. Now, keeping your elbows in at your sides and stationary, curl one dumbbell straight up in front of you. Do not swing up the weight.
3. Hold for 2 seconds, contracting the bicep muscles.
4. Slowly return to starting position.
