1. This movement is performed in a bent-over standing position. You will need access to cables from a machine, otherwise use dumbbells.
2. Stand between two cables which are attached at the floor level. Keep a wide stance to keep balance. Grasp a handle in each hand; your left hand holding the right cable and your right hand holding the left cable. This will cross your hands in front of you. Bend forward.
3. You may also do this one arm at a time as depicted in the pictures above.
4. Now keeping a strict form, pull each cable simultaneously straight out to your sides.
5. Hold for 1-2 seconds and release back to starting position.
