1. Begin in a lying position, flat on your back. Grasp the ball with your legs firmly between your hamstrings and calves.
2. Lying flat with hands extended on the ground at your sides, slowly squeeze the ball by pushing with your heels to your glutes.
3. After a few seconds, release but continue to hold the ball. Repeat to complete your set.
