1. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and slightly bent to relieve stress from your lower back.
2. Grasp the barbell with an underhand grip, as well keep your thumbs under the bar rather than over top. Begin with the bar hanging straight down. Now, keeping your elbows in at your sides and stationary, curl the barbell straight up.
3. Hold for 2 seconds, contracting the bicep muscles.
4. Slowly return to the starting position.
