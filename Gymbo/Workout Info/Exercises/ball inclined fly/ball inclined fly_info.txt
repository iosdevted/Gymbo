1. Lay securely on the stability ball, with your your hips in the air. Create an incline angle with your body by lowering your hips to the ground.
2. Grasp a dumbbell in each arm with an overhand grip. Your palms will face each other as you bring the weights up above your chest. You arms have a slight bend in the elbow but are facing straight up.
3. Lower the dumbbells down to either side at the same time. Go down far enough to feel a slight stretch in the pectorals.
4. Hold for 1-2 seconds and the press back up maintaining the same arc motion.
