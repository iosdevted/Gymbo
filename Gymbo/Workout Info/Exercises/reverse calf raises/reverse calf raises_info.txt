1. This movement is performed simply on a block and your body weight.
2. Stand on the block with only your heels. Grab onto something sturdy for balance.
3. Be sure to have your knees slightly bent. With your heels on the block, lower your toes as low as you can, feeling a stretch in the front of your lower leg. Now, lift up your toes as high as you can, contract.
4. Slowly lower your toes back down to the starting position and repeat the movement.
