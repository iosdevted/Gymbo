1. This is a standard push-up performed with your hands close together under the chest.
2. Try to keep your back straight and your arms about shoulder-width apart. Make sure your back doesn't hunch or sag down.
3. While focusing on your triceps, slowly lower your body by bending your arms at the elbows. Lower until you are within an inch of the floor. Focus on the stretch.
4. Hold for 1-2 seconds, then push back up to the starting position.
