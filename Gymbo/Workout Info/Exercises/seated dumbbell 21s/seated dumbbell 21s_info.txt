1. This movement is performed with dumbbells in a seated position on a bench.
2. Sit on the bench with your feet close together and your back straight.
3. You must keep your elbows in at your sides during the exercise. This exercise consists of 3 sets of repetitions. First, begin with your arms both hanging straight down. Now, curl up one arm but stop half way. Now lower the dumbbell back down. Perform this for 7 reps. Without pausing, curl the same arm all the way to the top, then lower the weight to the half way point and back up again. Perform this for 7 reps. Finally, perform 7 reps of full dumbell curls from the bottom to the top.
4. Repeat the movement with your other arm.
