3. Lean over the the pad provided. You may need to lower it so that it is snug in your underarm. Grasp the cable with an underhand grip. Begin with your arms extended down, do not hyper extend. Now, keeping your elbows flat on the pad and not leaning forward, curl the cable straight up in front of you.
