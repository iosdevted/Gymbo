1. This movement is performed on a slightly inclined bench, roughly 30 degrees. Lie down on the bench, placing your feet flat on the ground.
2. Be sure to keep your back flat against the bench. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand. Bring each dumbbell to shoulder height, keeping your palms facing forward and your elbows straight down.
3. Simultaneously press the dumbbells up overhead, bringing them together at the top of the movement. Contract your pectorals.
4. Hold or 1-2 seconds, then lower the weights back down to the starting position.
