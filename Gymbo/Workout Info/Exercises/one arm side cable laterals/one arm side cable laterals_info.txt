1. This movement is only possible with a cable which is attached at the ground level. If there is no access to this piece of equipment, please use a dumbbell.
2. In a standing position, knees slightly bent; grasp the handle to the cable with your hand which is opposite to the handle's origin. Place the other hand on the the machine for balance or on your hip.
3. Carefully, with your elbow locked at a slight angle, lift in an arc with your arm straight to your side. Once your hand, elbow and shoulder are in line, pause for a second.
4. Next, lower the weight back to the starting position.
