1. This movement is performed with a dumbbell in a seated position.
2. Sit on a bench, leaving enough room to place your arms on. Bend forward slightly.
3. Grasp the dumbbell with an overhand grip. Your arm should be flat on the bench with your hand at the edge so it can bend down. First, bend your wrist to allow for the weight to hang down, you will feel a stretch. Next, roll the weight up until your upper forearm contracts.
4. Slowly lower the weight back to a fully extended position. Repeat the movement with the other arm.
