1. This exercise should be done with very light weights, as the rear deltoids are a very small muscle. Keep the focus on maintaining proper form.. not on the amount of weight used. Be sure to perform this exercise slowly and carefully, concentrating on the muscle in use. Do not stretch past your own flexibility and physical means, remember safety always come first.
