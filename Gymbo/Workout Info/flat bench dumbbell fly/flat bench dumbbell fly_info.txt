1. This movement is performed on a flat bench. When you are in position, place your feet flat on the ground for balance and to avoid injury to lower back.
2. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand. Start with the dumbbells together directly above your chest. Your elbows should be slightly bent, and your palms facing each other.
3. Carefully - simultaneously, lower the weights down to either sides of your body. You will feel a stretch in the outer pectorals. Keep your palms facing inward and maintain a slight bend in the elbows. Once the dumbbells are parallel with the bench, pause.
4. Hold and contract for 1-2 seconds, then raise your arms back to the top following the same arc.
