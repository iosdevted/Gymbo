Performing squats with a Smith Machine allows you to isolate your quadriceps while taking away much of the strain from your lower back and knees. This exercise is great, especially to develop mass and strength in the front of the thigh, the quadriceps. It is very important to keep a few things in mind. Always keep your back flat and your head up as well. Also, push with the heels of your feet, this will take stress from your lower back and target the quadriceps more efficiently.
