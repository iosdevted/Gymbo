1. This movement is performed with a barbell, starting with the bar located on the ground.
2. Stand behind the bar, facing it. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees slightly to relieve stress from your lower back.
3. Grasp the bar with your palms facing in. Take a wide grip. Now, keeping your back flat and parallel to the ground, bring the bar up keeping your elbows close to your sides. The bar should touch your upper abs, or the bottom of your rib cage.
4. Hold and contract for 1-2 seconds. Then slowly release back down.
