1. Stand with feet shoulder width apart, stepping on the rubber band with both feet. You will have to cross the bands under your feet to get proper tension.
2. Keeping your legs and back straight, and sticking your buttocks out, bend at the hips and reach down until you feel a stretch in the hamstring muscles.
3. Slowly return to starting position, contracting the hamstrings.
