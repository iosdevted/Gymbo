The key in this exercise is to get a good stretch at the bottom as well as a good contraction at the top. If you would like added benefit, when you extend the weight down, let the weight roll down your fingers to get a further stretch. Also, when you contract the weight at the top, lift you arms slightly towards you to get a greater contraction.
