1. This movement is performed with a barbell in a seated position.
2. Sit on a bench, leaving enough room to place your arm on. Bend forward slightly.
3. Grasp the barbell with an underhand grip, as well keep your thumbs under the grip rather than over top. Place your hands very close together matched by your elbows. Your arms should be flat on the bench with your hands at the edge so they are able to bend down. First, bend your wrist to allow for the weight to hang down, you will feel a stretch. Next, roll the weight up until your forearm contracts.
4. Slowly lower the weight back to a fully extended position. Repeat the movement.
