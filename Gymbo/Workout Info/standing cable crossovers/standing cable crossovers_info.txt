1. This movement is performed in a standing position. Locate yourself between two overhead attached cables.
2. Grasp a pulley with each hand. Lean forward slightly in this exercise. Bend your knees slightly as well to relieve any stress on your lower back muscles. Extend your arms out to the origin of the pulleys, keeping your wrist locked and elbows slightly bent.
3. Simultaneously, bring each cable down at a 45 degree angle. Touch your knuckles together and contract your pectoral muscles.
4. Hold for 1-2 seconds, then release back to the starting position.
