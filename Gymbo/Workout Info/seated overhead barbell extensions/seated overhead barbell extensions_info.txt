1. This exercise is performed seated with a short back support. Sitting backwards on a preacher bench, as shown in the pictures, provides excellent support.
2. Hold the barbell straight up above your head. Using an EZ-curl bar as shown in the pictures will make the exercise easier on your wrists.
3. Keeping your elbows by your ears and pointing straight in front, lower the dumbbell until your arms make a 90 degree angle. Keep your elbows as stationary as possible.
4. Slowly raise to the starting position, contracting the triceps muscles.
