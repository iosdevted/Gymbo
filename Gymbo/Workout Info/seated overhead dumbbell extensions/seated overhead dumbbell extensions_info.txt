1. This exercise is performed seated with a short back support. Sitting backwards on a preacher bench, as shown in the pictures, provides excellent support.
2. Hold one dumbbell with both hands straight up above your head. Choose a grip that you feel most comfortable with. The most common grip is shown in the pictures, with your hands on the edge of the dumbbell. You can also put your thumbs around the bar of the dumbbell, keeping your palms on the inner side on the dumbbell. Ultimately, you want to let the dumbbell hang down like in the pictures.
3. Keeping your elbows by your ears and pointing straight in front, lower the dumbbell until your arms make a 90 degree angle. Keep your elbows as stationary as possible.
4. Slowly raise to the starting position, contracting the triceps muscles.
