1. Let's begin in a standing position. Body erect, feel slightly narrower than shoulder width, hands at your side and head forward.
2. Squat down, bending at your hips with your back straight and looking forward. Arms swung back.
3. With a quick pause at the bottom, push up with your feet into a jumping motion. Swing your hands from the back position to straight up in the air, reaching fully extended.
4. Pay close attention to your landing position as you can cause injury to your ankles and other areas. When landing, squat back to the lowered position and repeat.
